* come to an agreement on what platform we wish to commit to
* come to an agreement on what code we wish to store as repositories
* come to an agreement on the best structure and appropriate documentation for each repo
* identify each person responsible to push particular code (which may not be the most recent version, but the last agreed-upon working version).
* Set timelines that each repository should be established on host server.


Case in point, we will be sharing time with Li on Tuesday morning. I have the current source code of the DGM and was planning to establish a shared repo for us to use – once we discuss its destination.
The idea of migrating to gitlab is a bit frustrating for me as I’m well established on github. (Though I see gitlab has developed a repo migration tool.)  As a group we now have two shared github accounts, along with our personal accounts. Perhaps a migration to gitlab would be the impetuous to combine disparate repos into one gitlab account. (eg my ctctools R package, our dgm ‘planning’ repo, Catarina's ERAR along with other repos of mixed code).

A transition might allow us to come to some agreement on structure, documentation, and the true source code. And, as always intended, will finally allow us to track changes, reverse errors, and share the responsibility and knowledge of code that we all rely on.
